Advanced Development Assignment
==========================================

One of the assignments I completed in the final year of my computing course at university. It's far from perfect but it's a decent example of running Django on App Engine and integrating with various Google Cloud Services.

About / Features
========

- Django
- Designed to run on Google App Engine
- Integrates with the following Google Cloud services:
  - Cloud SQL
  - Datastore (via the ndb API)
  - Search
  - Cloud Storage
- Features:
  - Uploading media (images, audio, video, text) via admin panel or frontend
  - Embedding media into stories
  - User management and permissions system based on groups
  - Searching for stories and media
  - Uploading media via a very basic proof API
  - Searching and retrieving for media/stories via the API
  - Voting for stories and ranking stories on the frontend using vote counts
  - Setting the status of a story (draft, published)
  - Sorting stories/media in the admin panel

Why
===

1. Because
2. Hopefully this might be useful to someone else, getting Django to do what you want on App Engine is tricky at times.

Screenshots
===========

The app isn't live anymore so if you can't be bothered to run it locally there are some screenshots in the screenshots directory.
